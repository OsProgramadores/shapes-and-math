## Features

Shapes and Math provides interactive demonstrations and code samples for drawing and manipulating 2D shapes using the Canvas API. The following drawing functionalities are available:

- **Basic Shapes**
  - Draw lines between two points
  - Draw rectangles (filled and outlined)
  - Draw circles and ellipses (filled and outlined)
  - Draw polygons (custom number of sides)
  - Draw arcs and sectors

- **Transformations**
  - Move (translate) shapes
  - Rotate shapes around a point
  - Scale shapes

- **Styling**
  - Set stroke and fill colors
  - Adjust line width and style
  - Apply transparency (alpha)

- **Text Rendering**
  - Draw text at any position
  - Set font, size, and color

- **Math Visualizations**
  - Plot mathematical functions (e.g., sine, cosine, parabola)
  - Visualize geometric constructions (e.g., triangle medians, bisectors)
  - Display coordinate axes and grids

- **Interactivity**
  - Mouse-based shape manipulation (drag, resize, rotate)
  - Real-time parameter adjustment (e.g., number of polygon sides)
